# SimAwareFork - A Fork of SimAware

## Description

SimAwareFork is a fork of SimAware, a Discord Rich Presence implementation for Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2020. My version contains a minor change to the code in order for the application to
display only your altitude and ground speed (in both knots and mph).
